        <!-- <h2>Introduction</h2> -->
        <p>Hi, I'm Valter, a Portuguese guy living in Belgium since 2015 with a
           background in mechanical engineering. I'm excited for the next 4
           months, where I plan to learn as much as possible to be a valuable
           asset to my future employer, VDAB.</p>

        <h2>Software Development Experience</h2>
        <p>In September 2021, I enrolled on an evening course in C#, where I
           had the opportunity to get familiar with the following subjects:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic, Functional, Object Oriented and Advanced Programming in
              C#;</li>
          <li>Databases;</li>
          <li>Software Architecture;</li>
          <li>ASP.Net;</li>
        </ul>
        <p><br/></p>
        <p>Projects:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Development of an application to test Time-Series for
                correctness;</li>
            <li>Library Management application (in progress);</li>
            <li>An order system capable of tracking and managing product
                inventory (in progress);</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>C# vs Java</h2>
          <p>Since I'll be diving into Java, I figured it'd be interesting to
            go over the main differences compared to C#.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Spending time with my family and friends is where I invest most of my
           free time.  I also love to travel, but I spend most of my vacations
           going to Portugal :)<br/>I also get a lot of joy from playing a
           basketball game or going for an MTB ride, as you can see from the
           picture above!</p>
